# House Prices Prediction Model

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features. The dataset is analyzed, preprocessed, and trained using appropriate regression techniques to achieve accurate predictions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction of house prices based on input features

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-prices-prediction.git
   cd house-prices-prediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset and train the model:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook model_train.ipynb
   ```
2. Modify the notebook or script as needed for custom predictions.
3. Use the trained model to predict house prices based on input features.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset should be placed in the `data/` directory. Ensure it is properly formatted for seamless processing.

## Results
The trained model achieves competitive accuracy in predicting house prices. Evaluation metrics such as RMSE and RÂ² are used to assess performance.
